All creatures of our God and King 
Am7 
Lift up your voice and with us sing

Oh praise him  Oh praise him

Though burning sun with golden beams

Though silver moon with softer gleam

Oh praise him  Oh praise him

Alleluia  Alleluia  Alleluia 
 
Thou rushing wind that art so strong, 
Ye clouds that sail in heav'n along, 
O praise Him! Alleluia! 
Thou rising morn, in praise rejoice, 
Ye lights of evening, find a voice! 
O praise Him, O praise Him! 
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! 
 
And all ye men of tender heart, 
Forgiving others, take your part, 
O sing ye! Alleluia! 
Ye who long pain and sorrow bear, 
Praise GOd and on Him cast your care! 
O praise Him, O praise Him! 
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! 
 
Let all things their Creator bless, 
And worship Him in humbleness, 
O praise Him! Alleluia! 
Praise, praise the Father, praise the Son, 
And praise the Spirit, Three in One! 
O praise Him, O praise Him! 
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!
