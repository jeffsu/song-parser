C 
All creatures of our God and King 
Am7 
Lift up your voice and with us sing 
     F            
Oh praise him  Oh praise him 
C 
Though burning sun with golden beams 
Am7 
Though silver moon with softer gleam 
    F             C/G 
Oh praise him  Oh praise him 
  F          Am7    G     C 
Alleluia  Alleluia  Alleluia 
 
Thou rushing wind that art so strong, 
Ye clouds that sail in heav'n along, 
O praise Him! Alleluia! 
Thou rising morn, in praise rejoice, 
Ye lights of evening, find a voice! 
O praise Him, O praise Him! 
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!
